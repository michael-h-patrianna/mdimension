=== CRITICAL INSTRUCTION BLOCK (CIB-001)===

## MANDATORY TOOLS

### For Complex Tasks (research, analysis, debugging)
```
USE: mcp__mcp_docker__sequentialthinking
WHEN: Multi-step problems, research, complex reasoning
WHY: Prevents cognitive overload, ensures systematic approach
```

### For Task Management
```
USE: TodoWrite
WHEN: Any task with 3+ steps
WHY: Tracks progress, maintains focus
```

### For Research and Validation of Solutions
```
USE: WebSearch
WHEN: Any non-trivial debugging, planning, solution design task
WHY: Offers quick access to best practices and solutions
```

## MANDATORY CODE STYLE AND ARCHITECTURE RULES
Coding agents must follow `docs/meta/styleguide.md` - No exceptions!
All shaders MUST use WebGL2/GLSL ES 3.00 syntax (`in`/`out`, `layout`, no `attribute`/`varying`/`gl_FragColor`).

## THREE.JS DPR/VIEWPORT GOTCHA

**CRITICAL**: When rendering to WebGLRenderTarget at non-standard resolutions, NEVER use `gl.setViewport()`. It internally multiplies by device pixel ratio (DPR), causing incorrect rendering on high-DPI displays.

```typescript
// ✗ WRONG - DPR multiplication breaks non-standard resolution targets
gl.setRenderTarget(target);
gl.setViewport(0, 0, target.width, target.height);

// ✓ CORRECT - exact pixel values, no DPR multiplication
target.viewport.set(0, 0, target.width, target.height);
gl.setRenderTarget(target);
```

For fullscreen quad shaders rendered manually (not via ShaderPass), use direct NDC coordinates:
```glsl
// ✗ WRONG - camera matrices affected by DPR
gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);

// ✓ CORRECT - direct NDC for PlaneGeometry(2, 2)
gl_Position = vec4(position.xy, 0.0, 1.0);
```

## MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL
1. Always complete all tasks fully. Do not simplify approaches, do not skip tasks.
2. Always keep tests up to date and maintain 100% test coverage.
3. Always test. 100% of tests must pass.
4. Always fix bugs. Never changes tests only to make them pass if the cause is in the code it is testing.
5. Never run Vitest in watch mode; automation must use `npm test`. Only set `ALLOW_VITEST_WATCH=1` when a human explicitly authorizes interactive debugging.
6. **CRITICAL**: After implementing new functionality, ALWAYS create comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for logic and components (Vitest)
   - Integration tests for game flow
   - Playwright tests for frontend functionality (must visually confirm UI works)
   - All tests must be in `src/tests/` or `scripts/playwright/`
   - Run ALL tests before considering task complete
   - Maintain 100% test coverage - no exceptions

## TEST MEMORY MANAGEMENT

**CRITICAL**: The test suite previously caused memory exhaustion by spawning 13 workers consuming 9GB+ RAM. This has been fixed but requires vigilance.

### Configuration Safeguards (DO NOT MODIFY without review)
- `maxWorkers: 4` in `vitest.config.ts` - Prevents excessive process spawning
- `pool: 'threads'` - Uses memory-efficient threading instead of forks
- `environment: 'happy-dom'` - Fast DOM implementation for all tests

### Before Changing Test Configuration
1. **VERIFY**: Worker count stays ≤ 4, total memory < 2GB
2. **DOCUMENT**: Update guide if making configuration changes

### Writing Memory-Safe Tests
- **DON'T**: Generate 1000+ data points in a single test without batching
- **DO**: Process in batches of 100 and clear arrays between batches
- **DON'T**: Rely on DOM for pure logic tests if not needed (keep them simple)
- **DO**: Use component tests (`.test.tsx`) only for UI components
- **DON'T**: Forget to cleanup timers/listeners in afterEach
- **DO**: Call `cleanup()` from @testing-library/react in test teardown

### Emergency Response
If system becomes unresponsive during tests:
```bash
killall -9 node  # Force kill all Node processes
node scripts/cleanup-vitest.mjs  # Clean up lingering workers
```

## FOLDER USAGE RULES

| Activity | Required Directory | Agent Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser automation (Playwright/Puppeteer runners, recorders) | `scripts/playwright/` | Keep every `.js`/`.mjs` harness here. Subfolders allowed, but **never** place these scripts in the repo root. |
| Physics, RNG, or analytics utilities | `scripts/tools/` | Import from `../../src` or `../../dist` as needed. No tooling lives in the project root. |
| Visual artifacts (screenshots, videos, GIFs) | `screenshots/` | Always persist captured assets here. Create nested folders like `screenshots/quality-test/` or `screenshots/videos/` to stay organized. |
| Documentation, research notes | `docs/` | Long-form analysis belongs in this directory instead of new markdown files at the root. |
| Temporary experiments / sandboxes | `src/dev-tools/` | Use this workspace for throwaway UI/physics spikes and clean it up after. |
| 🚫 Forbidden | Project root | Keep root pristine—no scripts, screenshots, or scratch docs. |
