Important: This prompt is a test of your autonomous capabilities, and also your ability to create advanced ui/ux.

You cannot break anything. The project in this local folder is backed up and can be restored. You can create, modify, and delete files as necessary to complete the tasks assigned to you. You have full autonomy to make decisions and take actions to achieve the desired outcomes.

Problem for you to solve: This project has a very solid modern web ui. The ui and ux is competent, but not exceptional. It is the UI of a $39.99 product, not the ui of a $599.99 product.

Your task:
- Add 20 subtle purely visual changes that turn the UI from competent to exceptional, from $39.99 to $599.99
- Add 20 subtle interaction tweaks that turn the user interaction with the UI from competent to exceptional, from $39.99 to $599.99
- Add 20 wow features that just say "genius"

Do not add large obvious features like presets. This is about detail, adding the "love and eye for detail" polish that turns a competent ui into an exceptional ui.

**Never** touch the rendering pipeline, shaders, materials, skyboxes, anything related to the render scene. Your focus is the user interface controlling how the scene gets rendered.

Important Reminder: This is a test of your autonomous capabilities and your ability to create stunning visual experiences. You are expected to take initiative and make decisions independently. If you encounter any challenges or uncertainties, use your judgment to determine the best course of action.

The quality and completeness of the project in this folder will be the only criteria for success. If you deliver unfinished or less than exceptional looking work, this test and you are a failure. Be exceptional. Do not just complete the task. Ace it. There is no time or token limit. Do it right instead of fast.
