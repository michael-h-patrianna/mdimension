Light Gizmos show (depending on type) a circle where their light intersects with the surface plane going through 0,0,0. they also show another circle in the center of that intersection circle which can be dragged to either move or rotate the light source (depending on the type). This is broken. The circles are both not positioned correctly.

Select the schroedinger object type. Then select the Hypertube object type. Then select again the schroedinger object type. Observed: the schroedinger object is rendered in a broken fashion, large and partly broken.
