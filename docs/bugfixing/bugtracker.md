Light Gizmos show (depending on type) a circle where their light intersects with the surface plane going through 0,0,0. they also show another circle in the center of that intersection circle which can be dragged to either move or rotate the light source (depending on the type). This is broken. The circles are both not positioned correctly.

Select the schroedinger object type. Then select the Hypertube object type. Then select again the schroedinger object type. Observed: the schroedinger object is rendered in a broken fashion, large and partly broken. it seems to be enlarged and moved to the top right. This only happens when Temporal Refraction is on, and animation is on.

The max FPS feature is unstable. Sometimes it will after launch and the initial fps drop cap the max FPS at 30 (instead of the default 60). Sometimes it will ignore the cap (set to 60 default) and render at higher frame rates at what the system supports.

In the performance monitor's shader section, for every shader that is composed, I am supposed to be able to toggle on/off modules of the shader and the shader gets rebuilt/compiled with the toggled module removed/added, so I can debug the impact of a certain module. This is not working at all for none of the shaders.

The slider label and track sometimes have a different distance/gap from each other. For example, the Speed and the Bias slider in the timingcontrol component have different gaps which makes it look broken.
