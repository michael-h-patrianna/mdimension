# IFS / Orbit-Trap Field Fractals

## Overview

**Feature**: IFS/Orbit-Trap Field Fractals - A fractal type that iterates a transform and measures how close the orbit comes to geometric "traps" (planes, spheres, tori, lines) in N-dimensional space. The resulting field produces soft tissue, foamy bubbles, and wispy membrane structures.

**Core concept**: Instead of a strict SDF fractal surface, track `d = min(d, distanceToTrap(z))` during iteration. The accumulated minimum distance creates a scalar field for rendering.

**Why it morphs well**: Trap geometry can be defined in any dimensions, and rotating the slice changes which dimensions intersect the traps, creating dramatically different membrane/bubble patterns.

**Reference**: See `docs/prd/extended-fractal-types.md` Section 5 for mathematical foundation.

## User Story 1: Core IFS Orbit-Trap Renderer

**User story:** As a user, I want to view an IFS Orbit-Trap fractal so that I can explore soft, foamy, and membrane-like structures.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. User can select "Orbit Trap" from the fractal type selector in the geometry panel
2. When selected, the viewport displays a 3D slice through the N-dimensional orbit-trap field
3. The fractal is rendered by raymarching an isosurface of the orbit-trap field
4. Field computation: iterate transform F(z), track dTrap = min(dTrap, trapDistance(z))
5. Default iteration transform: Simple contraction/rotation (IFS attractor)
6. Default trap: Single sphere trap at origin with radius 0.5
7. Dimension selector: 3D-11D (default: 4D)
8. Iteration count defaults to 20
9. Isosurface threshold default: 0.1
10. Raymarch uses smaller steps (safety factor 0.5) since field is not a true SDF
11. Frame rate remains above 30fps at default quality

**Test scenarios**

Scenario 1: Select Orbit-Trap fractal type
- Given the user is viewing any fractal
- When the user selects "Orbit Trap" from dropdown
- Then the viewport displays soft, membrane-like structures

Scenario 2: Default sphere trap
- Given default configuration with sphere trap
- When the fractal renders
- Then bubble-like structures appear where orbit passes near the sphere

Scenario 3: Field stability
- Given raymarching the orbit-trap field
- When step sizes are computed
- Then smaller steps (safety factor) ensure stable rendering of non-SDF field

Scenario 4: Camera interaction
- Given the user is viewing the Orbit-Trap fractal
- When the user orbits, pans, zooms
- Then the soft structures update smoothly
