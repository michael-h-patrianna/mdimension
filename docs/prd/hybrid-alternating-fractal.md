# Hybrid / Alternating Formulas Fractals

## Overview

**Feature**: Hybrid/Alternating Formulas Fractals - A fractal type that alternates between two or more transformation rules each iteration, combining characteristics of multiple fractal families (e.g., bulb-power + boxfold/spherefold).

**Core concept**: Instead of one function F, iteration alternates: `F0(z)` on even iterations, `F1(z)` on odd iterations. This creates competing rules that produce rich morphing under rotation.

**Why it morphs well**: The interplay between different transformation types creates structural tension—changes in slice orientation shift how the competing rules interact, producing dramatic shape evolution.

**Reference**: See `docs/prd/extended-fractal-types.md` Section 4 for mathematical foundation.

## User Story 1: Core Hybrid Fractal Renderer

**User story:** As a user, I want to view a Hybrid fractal so that I can explore complex structures created by combining multiple transformation rules.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. User can select "Hybrid" from the fractal type selector in the geometry panel
2. When selected, the viewport displays a 3D slice through the N-dimensional hybrid fractal
3. The fractal uses alternating formulas: F0 on even iterations, F1 on odd iterations
4. Default configuration: F0 = Bulb Power (p=8), F1 = BoxFold + SphereFold
5. Distance estimate uses hybrid derivative tracking with safety factor (dist *= 0.8)
6. Iteration count defaults to 16 (lower than single-formula fractals due to combined transforms)
7. Dimension selector: 3D-11D (default: 4D)
8. The fractal responds to standard camera controls
9. Frame rate remains above 30fps at default quality

**Test scenarios**

Scenario 1: Select Hybrid fractal type
- Given the user is viewing any fractal
- When the user selects "Hybrid" from dropdown
- Then the viewport displays a Hybrid fractal combining bulb and fold characteristics

Scenario 2: Default hybrid structure
- Given default configuration (bulb + boxfold/spherefold)
- When the fractal renders
- Then the structure shows both organic bulb curves and crystalline fold edges

Scenario 3: Change dimension
- Given 4D Hybrid fractal
- When the user changes dimension to 6D
- Then additional dimensional folding creates more complex structures

Scenario 4: Derivative safety factor
- Given raymarching is active
- When step sizes are computed
- Then the safety factor prevents over-stepping near complex hybrid boundaries

   - "Bulb Power": N-dimensional Mandelbulb power transform
   - "BoxFold": Componentwise fold to box boundary
   - "SphereFold": Radial inversion fold
   - "Kali Reciprocal": abs(z) / dot(z,z) + c
   - "Identity": No transform (pass-through)

3. "Advanced" toggle reveals additional slots:
   - Slot 2 (every 3rd iteration)
   - Slot 3 (every 4th iteration)
4. Hybrid preset dropdown:
   - "Classic Mandelbox": BoxFold + SphereFold + Scale
   - "Bulb-Box": Bulb Power + BoxFold/SphereFold

## User Story 3: Bulb Power Transform Controls

**User story:** As a user, I want to configure the Bulb Power transform so that I can control the organic bulb characteristics in the hybrid.

**Acceptance criteria**

**Test scenarios**

Scenario 1: Adjust bulb power
