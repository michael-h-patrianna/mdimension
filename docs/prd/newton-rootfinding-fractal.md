# Newton / Root-Finding Fractals

## Overview

**Feature**: Newton/Root-Finding Fractals - A fractal type based on Newton's method for solving `F(z) = 0`. The fractal structure emerges from the boundaries between basins of attraction, creating veins, membranes, and branching organic patterns.

**Core concept**: Instead of escape-time iteration, Newton's method `z_{n+1} = z_n - F(z_n) / F'(z_n)` converges to roots. The fractal boundaries appear where convergence is slow or ambiguous.

**Why it morphs well**: Basin boundaries in hypercomplex space are extremely sensitive to slice orientation, producing dramatic changes in vein/membrane structure.

**Reference**: See `docs/prd/extended-fractal-types.md` Section 3 for mathematical foundation.

## User Story 1: Core Newton Fractal Renderer

**User story:** As a user, I want to view a Newton fractal so that I can explore the intricate basin boundaries of root-finding algorithms.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. User can select "Newton" from the fractal type selector in the geometry panel
2. When selected, the viewport displays a 3D slice through the 4D quaternion Newton fractal
3. The fractal is rendered using raymarching on a scalar field derived from:
   - Convergence speed (iterations to converge)
   - Or `length(F)` as an isosurface value
   - Or basin boundary measure
4. Default polynomial is `q³ - 1` (classic Newton fractal with 3 roots)
5. Default dimension is 4D (quaternion space)
6. Iteration count defaults to 32 with convergence tolerance 0.001
7. Quaternion inverse is computed as `qinv(q) = conj(q) / dot(q,q)`
8. The fractal responds to standard camera controls
9. Frame rate remains above 30fps at default quality

**Test scenarios**

Scenario 1: Select Newton fractal type
- Given the user is viewing any fractal in the viewport
- When the user selects "Newton" from the fractal type dropdown
- Then the viewport displays the Newton fractal with basin boundary structures

Scenario 2: Default cubic polynomial
- Given the user has just selected Newton fractal
- When the fractal renders with default settings
- Then three distinct convergence basins are visible corresponding to the three roots of `z³ - 1`

Scenario 3: Convergence stability
- Given the raymarcher samples various points in quaternion space
- When Newton iteration runs to convergence
- Then no NaN artifacts occur even at basin boundaries

Scenario 4: Camera interaction
- Given the user is viewing the Newton fractal
- When the user orbits, pans, or zooms
- Then the fractal view updates smoothly

## User Story 2: Polynomial Selection & Configuration

**User story:** As a user, I want to choose different polynomials so that I can explore Newton fractals with varying numbers of roots and complexity.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. Polynomial preset dropdown offers:
   - "Cubic (z³ - 1)": 3 roots, classic Newton
   - "Quartic (z⁴ - 1)": 4 roots, more complex boundaries
   - "Quintic (z⁵ - 1)": 5 roots
   - "Quadratic (z² - 1)": 2 roots, simpler structure
   - "Custom Cubic": User-defined coefficients
   - "Custom Quartic": User-defined coefficients
2. For custom polynomials, coefficient sliders appear:
   - For `az³ + bz² + cz + d - k`, sliders for a, b, c, d, k
   - Coefficient ranges: -2.0 to 2.0, step 0.01
3. The constant term `k` can be a quaternion (4 components)
4. Changes update the fractal in real-time
5. Tooltip explains root count relationship to polynomial degree

**Test scenarios**

Scenario 1: Switch to quartic polynomial
- Given cubic polynomial (z³ - 1) is active
- When the user selects "Quartic (z⁴ - 1)"
- Then the fractal updates to show 4-basin structure with more complex boundaries

Scenario 2: Adjust custom coefficients
- Given "Custom Cubic" is selected
- When the user adjusts coefficient `b` from 0 to 0.5
- Then the fractal structure changes to reflect the modified polynomial

Scenario 3: Quaternion constant k
- Given custom polynomial is active
- When the user adjusts the k quaternion components
- Then root positions shift and basin boundaries morph

Scenario 4: Invalid polynomial (leading coefficient zero)
- Given the user sets the leading coefficient to 0
- When the fractal attempts to render
- Then a warning message appears: "Leading coefficient must be non-zero" and fractal uses last valid configuration

## User Story 3: Damping Factor Control

**User story:** As a user, I want to control the Newton iteration damping so that I can tune convergence behavior and basin structure.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. Damping factor slider available (range: 0.5-1.5, default: 1.0)
2. Newton step becomes: `z = z - damping * (F(z) / F'(z))`
3. Damping < 1.0 produces more stable but slower convergence (smoother boundaries)
4. Damping > 1.0 produces faster but potentially unstable convergence (chaotic boundaries)
5. Changes update fractal in real-time
6. Tooltip: "Controls step size in Newton iteration. Values < 1 smooth boundaries, > 1 create chaos."

**Test scenarios**

Scenario 1: Decrease damping for smoother boundaries
- Given damping is 1.0
- When the user decreases damping to 0.7
- Then basin boundaries become smoother and less fractal

Scenario 2: Increase damping for chaotic boundaries
- Given damping is 1.0
- When the user increases damping to 1.3
- Then basin boundaries become more chaotic and detailed

Scenario 3: Extreme damping stability
- Given the user sets damping to 1.5
- When the fractal renders
- Then it remains stable without diverging to infinity

## User Story 4: Convergence Visualization Modes

**User story:** As a user, I want to choose how convergence data is visualized so that I can see different aspects of the Newton fractal.

**Acceptance criteria**
1. Visualization mode dropdown offers:

   - "Residual Field": Surface where `length(F)` equals threshold
   - "Basin Boundaries": Emphasizes edges between convergence regions
   - "Root Distance": Based on final distance to nearest root
   - "Mixed": Combination of speed and boundary emphasis
2. For "Convergence Speed" mode:
   - Isosurface threshold slider (1-30 iterations, default: 10)
3. For "Residual Field" mode:
   - Tolerance threshold slider (0.0001-0.1, default: 0.001)
4. For "Basin Boundaries" mode:
   - Boundary sensitivity slider (0.1-2.0, default: 1.0)
5. Each mode produces distinct visual characteristics

**Test scenarios**

Scenario 1: Switch to Basin Boundaries mode
- Given Convergence Speed mode is active
- When the user selects "Basin Boundaries"
- Then the visualization emphasizes the boundaries between convergence regions as ridges/veins

Scenario 2: Adjust convergence threshold
- Given Convergence Speed mode with threshold 10
- When the user changes threshold to 20
- Then the isosurface expands to include slower-converging regions

Scenario 3: Residual field visualization
- Given any mode is active
- When the user selects "Residual Field" with tolerance 0.01
- Then the surface shows where Newton iteration residual equals the threshold

---

## Placeholders Requiring Confirmation
- Exact polynomial coefficient defaults for custom presets
- Optimal convergence tolerance for visual quality vs performance
- Root position computation for quaternion polynomials

## Open Questions
- Should fractional powers (z^2.5) be supported for exotic Newton fractals?
- Should relaxed Newton methods (other than simple damping) be offered?
- How should degenerate cases (multiple equal roots) be handled visually?

## Dependencies Between Stories
- Stories 2-6, 7, 9, 10 can be developed in parallel after Story 1
- Story 8 depends on Story 7
- Story 9 partially depends on Story 4 for convergence data
- Stories 11-13 depend on their respective parameter stories

## Ready for Development: YES
