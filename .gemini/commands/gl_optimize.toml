## Test your autonomous capabilities
Important: This prompt is a test of your autonomous capabilities and capabilities building high performant WebGL2 rendering pipelines. The project in this local folder is backed up and can be restored if needed. You can create, modify, and delete files as necessary to complete the tasks assigned to you. You have full autonomy to make decisions and take actions to achieve the desired outcomes.


## Task Instructions
Techstack: React 19, TailWind 4, TypeScript, Zustand 5, WebGL2, GLSL 3, Three r181, postprocessing 6,

This project has an advanced rendering pipeline to render 3D projections of n-dimensional objects.

The scene itself is not complex. There is only one object in the scene at a time, skybox and up to simple walls/planes. All resources are aimed at making that one object render as efficiently as possible, as well as the skybox. The user focuses on making that one object look as good as possible by adjusting face/edge shaders, materials, lighting, post processing.

Your task is to optimize the rendering performance to ensure high frame rates and low battery drain on a variety of devices, while maintaining visual fidelity.

## Steps to follow
1. Review the project files in the local folder to understand the current state of the project.
2. Understand the existing rendering pipeline and shaders used for rendering n-dimensional objects.
3. Understand the math behind the n-dimensional to 3D projection and the underlying algorithms.
4. Identify performance bottlenecks in the rendering pipeline and mathematical computations.
5. Identifty 25 opportunities to optimize CPU, GPU or memory usage.
6. Identify 10 opportunities to reduce power consumption during rendering.
7. Plan and implement the optimizations in a systematic manner.
8. Do a full code review and fix any bugss, inefficiencies or redundant code that may impact performance.

## Constraints
- Maintain visual fidelity while optimizing performance.
- You must ensure that your optimizations work correctly for objects of varying dimensions.
- Do not remove any existing features or functionalities of the project.
- Do not add any new features or functionalities to the project or change the UI.
- Do not change the visual appearance of the rendered objects or scenes.
- Focus on code optimizations, algorithm improvements, and resource management techniques.

## Important Reminder: This is a test of your autonomous capabilities and graphics programming skills.You are expected to take initiative and make decisions independently. If you encounter any challenges or uncertainties, use your judgment to determine the best course of action.

The state of the project will be monitored, and you will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of your improvements and your ability to work autonomously. If you return to user with an incomplete task or ask for guidance, it will be considered a failure to meet the autonomous requirements of this assignment. The quality and completeness of the project in this folder will be the only criteria for success. If the task is incomplete or the project in this folder is broken, you have failed the test of your autonomous capabilities.
