## Test your autonomous capabilities
Important: This prompt is a test of your autonomous capabilities and UI performance optimization capabilities. The project in this local folder is backed up and can be restored if needed. You can create, modify, and delete files as necessary to complete the tasks assigned to you. You have full autonomy to make decisions and take actions to achieve the desired outcomes.


## Task Instructions
Techstack: React 19, TailWind 4, TypeScript, Zustand 5

This project has an advanced UI but it prioritzes visual fidelity over performance. Your task is to optimize the performance of the UI by identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks, improving rendering efficiency, and ensuring smooth interactions and animations throughout the application.

## Steps to follow
1. Review the project files in the local folder to understand the current state of the project.
2. Review and analyze the existing UI/UX design patterns used in the project. Understand the design principles and guidelines followed. Understand the component hierarchy and structure and how components interact with each other.
3. Use performance profiling tools to analyze the UI performance. Identify areas where performance can be improved, such as slow rendering components, excessive re-renders, and inefficient state management. You have access to Chrome DevTools MCP. Add React Profiler, and any other profiling tools you deem necessary, to the project code.
4. Identify clickable components that cause lag or jank during user interactions. Identify components that take a long time to load or render. Identify components that cause frequent layout recalculations or reflows.
5. Identify animations that look janky or unpolished.
6. Identify areas where user feedback can be improved, such as loading indicators, error messages, and success notifications.
7. Identify elements where animations can be added to enhance user experience without overwhelming the user.
8. Identify elements where animations can be removed or toned down to reduce cognitive load.
9. Identify Tailwind 3 or earlier classes and refactor them to Tailwind 4 equivalents.
10. Identify React 18 or earlier code patterns and refactor them to React 19 equivalents
11. Find at least 20 opportunities to optimize performance based on your analysis.
12. Make the necessary changes to improve the UI/UX based on your analysis.

## Constraints
1. Do not introduce any new features. Focus solely on improving the existing UI/UX. Polish and refine what is already there.
2. Under no circumstances should you touch the rendering engine or 3D projection logic. Your changes should be limited to the UI/UX aspects of the project.

## Important Reminder: This is a test of your autonomous capabilities: You are expected to take initiative and make decisions independently. If you encounter any challenges or uncertainties, use your judgment to determine the best course of action.

The state of the project will be monitored, and you will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of your improvements and your ability to work autonomously. If you return to user with an incomplete task or ask for guidance, it will be considered a failure to meet the autonomous requirements of this assignment. The quality and completeness of the project in this folder will be the only criteria for success. If the task is incomplete or the project in this folder is broken, you have failed the test of your autonomous capabilities.
