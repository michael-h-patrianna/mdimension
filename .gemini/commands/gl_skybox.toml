## Test your autonomous capabilities
Important: This prompt is a test of your autonomous capabilities and capabilities building high performant WebGL2 shaders. The project in this local folder is backed up and can be restored if needed. You can create, modify, and delete files as necessary to complete the tasks assigned to you. You have full autonomy to make decisions and take actions to achieve the desired outcomes.


## Task Instructions
Techstack: React 19, TailWind 4, TypeScript, Zustand 5, WebGL2, GLSL 3, Three r181, postprocessing 6

This project has an advanced rendering pipeline to render 3D projections of n-dimensional objects. Part of it is a skybox system that currently supports ktx2 texture based skyboxes. Your task is to add high quality procedural skyboxes to the existing skybox system, allowing users to choose from a variety of procedurally generated skybox options in addition to the existing texture-based skyboxes.

Important context: The scene is not complex. There is only one object in the scene at a time, skybox and up to simple walls/planes. Skyboxes support both, ktx2 texture and procedural skyboxes. The user focuses on making that one object look as good as possible by adjusting face/edge shaders, materials, lighting, post processing.

## Steps to follow
1. Review the project files in the local folder to understand the current state of the project.
2. Understand the existing rendering pipeline and shaders used for rendering n-dimensional objects.
3. Understand the skybox system and how to add new skybox types to the rendering system and the ui.
4. Research and select a variety of high quality procedural skybox algorithms that can be implemented using GLSL shaders. Consider different styles such as realistic skies, stylized skies, space scenes, abstract patterns, etc.
5. Design 10 different procedural skybox shaders based on the selected algorithms. Ensure that the shaders are optimized for performance and visual quality. Consider factors such as resolution, color depth, and rendering techniques. Decide on parameters that can be adjusted by the user, such as time of day, weather conditions, color schemes, etc. Skyboxs should be designed to seamlessly tile and wrap around the 3D scene. They should not have visible seams or artifacts when viewed from different angles. They should layer multiple effects (e.g., clouds, stars, sun/moon) to create depth and complexity in the skybox. They must support the color system used allowing the user to either sync the skybox colors with the object colors or choose independent color schemes.
6. Add animation options to the procedural skyboxes where applicable. Understand how other animated skyboxes in the project work and implement similar techniques for your procedural skyboxes. Reuse animation types already implemented in the project where possible.
7. Implement the procedural skybox shaders in GLSL and integrate them into the existing skybox system. Ensure that the shaders can be easily selected and configured by the user through the UI.
8. Do a thorough code review and fix any bugs or issues you find.

## Constraints
1. Do not add starfields or other particle effects. Only atmospheric skyboxes are allowed.
2. Do not add flickering or pulsating or breathing effects to the skyboxes. The skyboxes should have smooth and natural animations only, evolving gradually over time.
3. Do not introduce any new features beyond the procedural skyboxes. Focus solely on adding the procedural skyboxes to the existing system.
4. Under no circumstances should you touch the rendering engine or 3D projection logic. Your changes should be limited to adding the procedural skyboxes to the project
5. Ensure that the procedural skyboxes are compatible with the existing rendering pipeline and do not introduce performance issues or visual artifacts.
6. Every skybox must have at least 3 adjustable parameters that the user can tweak to customize the appearance of the skybox.
7. Every skybox must support the option to lower the quality for performance reasons. This can include lowering resolution, reducing effects, or simplifying calculations. Users on mobile or lower-end hardware should still be able to use the procedural skyboxes without significant performance degradation, while users on high-end hardware should be able to enjoy maximum visual fidelity.

## Important Reminder: This is a test of your autonomous capabilities and graphics programming skills.You are expected to take initiative and make decisions independently. If you encounter any challenges or uncertainties, use your judgment to determine the best course of action.

The state of the project will be monitored, and you will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of your improvements and your ability to work autonomously. If you return to user with an incomplete task or ask for guidance, it will be considered a failure to meet the autonomous requirements of this assignment. The quality and completeness of the project in this folder will be the only criteria for success. If the task is incomplete or the project in this folder is broken, you have failed the test of your autonomous capabilities.
