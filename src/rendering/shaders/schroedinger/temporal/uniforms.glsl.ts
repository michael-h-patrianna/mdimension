/**
 * Uniform declarations for temporal cloud accumulation shaders
 *
 * NOTE: This file serves as documentation and a reference for the uniforms
 * used across the temporal accumulation system. The actual uniform declarations
 * are embedded directly in each shader (reprojection.glsl.ts, reconstruction.glsl.ts)
 * to allow per-shader customization.
 *
 * This block is NOT imported by other shaders - it's exported for potential
 * future use (e.g., generating TypeScript interfaces for uniform validation).
